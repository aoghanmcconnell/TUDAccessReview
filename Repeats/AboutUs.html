               <div class="box2"><h2>What are the principles of Universal Design?</h2>
        <p class="Aboutinfo">Universal Design is all about making stuff that works for everyone, no matter who they are. It's like designing things that are easy to use and don't leave anyone out. There are some important rules for Universal Design: things should be fair for everyone, easy to understand, and not too hard to use. Information should be clear, mistakes should be forgiving, and you shouldn't have to strain yourself. Everything should be just the right size and have enough space. <br>
            
            Universal Design is like making things friendly for everyone, so everyone can be happy.</p></div>

        <p class="Aboutinfo">
            Universal Design offers a wide range of advantages.<br> 
            
            By prioritizing inclusivity and accessibility, it ensures that environments, products, and services cater to diverse needs and abilities. This fosters a sense of belonging and equal participation, promoting societal diversity.<br>
            
            Universal Design can mitigate the need for costly retrofits or adaptations down the line, leading to economic efficiencies.Its user-centered approach enhances usability for everyone, streamlining interactions and reducing barriers.<br>
            
            Ultimately, Universal Design stands as a testament to an equitable and progressive ethos, harmonizing with the ideals of an inclusive and forward-thinking society
