                   <p class="Aboutinfo">To start of our programme we first did some research on the store to get information on its location (which you find on our <a href="location.html">Location</a> page. 
We decided to walk around the store. We tried to blend in as customers in order to see the ‘day to day’ in the store. First,  we walked around the surroundings outside and took photos off anything that took our interest. We then entered the store and took note of the entrances of the store. We walked around and took notice of the accessibility of the store, looking at any signage, listening to the general volume of the store and the effort that was made for universal design.

                   <p class="Aboutinfo">We then talked with staff about their experiences in the store and how accessible the store is to all people regardless of their disabilities/abilities. As it is also a busy workplace; we talked about the safety and accessibility protocols put into place to make the workplace a safe place for everyone. The staff spoke to us about the high demand of the work and how sometimes they have to rush around with their work trollies that could be considered dangerous. They told us the stockrooms are all accessible as well as they also have a staff elevator that can access all floors. They said that the stockrooms can be quite packed and not very spacious due to high demand of stock. They also said that they are giving no medical awareness and wouldn’t know what to do when it comes to instances where knowledge of accessibility and disabilities would be required.</p>
