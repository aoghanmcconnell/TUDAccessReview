               <div class="box2"><h2>The Shopfloor</h2>
        <p class="Aboutinfo">The shopfloor is very spacious with a 10 feet gap between aisles. 
The shelves are about 8 feet tall which is disappointing as they are not accessible to many people but there are always staff on each aisle to help people reach stuff. 
A big problem with the aisles are the work trollies that they do block up a lot of the aisle and sometimes do limit movement and space in the store but is understandable as it is a very busy store that requires a lot of staff and stock The shopfloor also has music that is played at a low volume but according to their website they have no silent hour which is disappointing as most other stores have silent hour which is an hour where music, bright lights and any other devices that may be overstimulating to people with autism are turned off so they can feel more comfortable in store.

               <div class="box2"><h2>The Car Park</h2>
        <p class="Aboutinfo">The carparks on the store grounds are large and spacious. They withhold around 300-400 spaces.  The first thing we noticed is the disabled parking spaces just outside the large opening automatic doors that are easily accessible to everyone. There are 6 disabled car spaces upstairs and 6 more in the underground car park. These spaces are wider than average car spaces which allows more accessibility. Given the size of the store, there probably should be more spaces than just 12 as they always seem occupied.

               <div class="box2"><h2>The Downstairs</h2>
        <p class="Aboutinfo">The upstairs and downstairs are both easily accessible as they have an escalator to, and from which have gripped handles and move at a safe pace. They have magnetic tracks on them that allows shopping-trollies and some wheelchairs to be safely attached to the tracks.The ramp is flush as possible, so customers donâ€™t trip, and wheelchairs can comfortably access it. The store also has a lift that is for people with inabilities to access the escalator that brings them to the shopfloor. The lift is spacious and has large buttons with large text that is also written in braille which makes the lift more accessible to people who are visually impaired. The lift is also flush to the ramp that makes it more accessible to people in wheelchairs.
